AppMon is an automated framework for monitoring and tampering system API calls of native macOS, iOS and android apps. It is based on [**Frida**](http://www.frida.re).

This project was only possible because of **Ole Andr√© Vadla Ravn√•s** and I dedicate it to him. Follow him on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/oleavr), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/oleavr)

It consists of the following components:

* AppMon Sniffer - Intercept API calls to figure out interesting operations performed by an App
* Appmon Intruder - Manipulate API calls data to create change app's original behavior
* AppMon Android Tracer - Automatically traces Java classes, methods, its arguments and their data-types in Android APKs
* AppMon IPA Installer - Creates and installs "inspectable" IPAs on non-jailbroken iOS devices
* AppMon APK Builder - Creates APKs "inspectable" on non-rooted Android devices
